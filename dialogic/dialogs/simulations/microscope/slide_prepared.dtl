Place your slide on the stage so that the specimen is directly over the hole.
This lets the light pass through the specimen for clear viewing.
Once the slide is positioned, click on the prongs to lock it in place.
Make sure the specimen stays centered and secure.
Take your time to ensure the slide is correctly placed.
