if {Simulations.PPE.selected_item_id} == "apron":
	Close, but fire aprons are mainly for flammable tasks...
	...Not for typical lab experiments.
if {Simulations.PPE.selected_item_id} == "lab_coat":
	Great choice!
	When spills or sharp objects are present...
	A long-sleeved lab coat protects your skin.
if {Simulations.PPE.selected_item_id} == "hazmat":
	Not quite!
	Hazmat suits are overkill for general lab work.
	It can be cumbersome for everyday experiments.
if {Simulations.PPE.selected_item_id} == "safety_goggles":
	Exactly!
	Goggles protect your eyes from chemicals and broken glass.
if {Simulations.PPE.selected_item_id} == "sunglasses":
	Incorrect.
	Sunglasses donâ€™t provide full coverage from splashes or particles.
	It may in fact limit your ability to see!
	Because Sunglasses dim your surroundings...
	...There could be repurcussions from not being able to properly see when in the lab.
if {Simulations.PPE.selected_item_id} == "prescription_glasses":
	Not a bad answer!
	While prescription glasses are in fact quite necessary to see, it's important to wear protection over them.
	Particles launching at your glasses can lead to serious injuries as glass can shatter in your eye!
if {Simulations.PPE.selected_item_id} == "nitrile_gloves":
	Perfect!
	Nitrile gloves shield your hands from chemicals, contamination, and minor cuts.
	Always ensure they fit snugly to maximize protection.
if {Simulations.PPE.selected_item_id} == "wool_gloves":
	Not ideal!
	Wool gloves offer warmth but no protection against chemicals or sharp objects.
	They can absorb hazardous liquids, making them unsafe in the lab.
if {Simulations.PPE.selected_item_id} == "rawdog":
	Definitely not!
	Exposing bare hands to chemicals or broken glass is extremely dangerous.
	Always use proper gloves to prevent serious injuries.
if {Simulations.PPE.selected_item_id} == "sneakers":
	Okay!
	Sneakers cover most of your foot, but be careful as they can let liquids seep through if not waterproof.
	Closed-toe, chemical-resistant shoes are preferred.
if {Simulations.PPE.selected_item_id} == "sandals":
	Incorrect!
	Sandals leave your feet exposed to spills, broken glass, or dropped equipment.
	Never wear them in a lab setting.
if {Simulations.PPE.selected_item_id} == "high_heels":
	Definitely not!
	High heels are unsafe in the lab.
	They limit mobility and increase the risk of accidents with chemicals or heavy objects.
