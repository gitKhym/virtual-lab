It’s your very first day as a lab intern.  You feel nervousness, eagerness, confusion and everything. \
You also forgot your lunch........................
The Lab Supervisor hops into view.  \
Yes — *hops.* Because the Supervisor is a kangaroo.

…Wait.  \
You’re a kangaroo???
harvey: Sharp eyes, intern. That’s why I hired you.
No, seriously. You’re a kangaroo with a coat.\
With pockets too. \
…How is that even?
harvey: Relax. Perfectly normal.  See I got my license. *Its rough drawing of himself and some gibberish words like scientist*
…I feel like I’m in the wrong place.
harvey: Wrong or right, I am in charge here.  \
Now listen up, before you *hop* to conclusions.  hehe, get it?
harvey: All right, intern. Before you start, you need to suit up\
properly.  PPE is your first line of defense in the lab.
harvey: Check the wardrobe on your right. Now go, clock's ticking,,
