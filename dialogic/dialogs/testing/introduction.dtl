It’s your very first day as a lab intern.  You feel nervousness, eagerness, confusion and everything.  You also forgot your lunch........................
Narrator\
The Lab Supervisor hops into view.  Yes  *hops.* Because the Supervisor is a kangaroo.

…Wait.  You’re a kangaroo???
???\
Sharp eyes, intern. That’s why I hired you.
Player\
No, seriously. You’re a kangaroo with a coat. With pockets too.…How is that even?
???\
Relax. Perfectly normal. Name's Harvey and  heres I got my license.  *Its rough drawing of himself and some gibberish words .
Player\
…I feel like I’m in the wrong place.
Harvey\
Wrong or right, I am in charge here.  Now listen up, before you *hop* to conclusions.  hehe, get it?
Harvey\
All right, intern. Before you start, you need to suit up properly.  PPE is your first line of defense in the lab.
Harvey\
Check the wardrobe on your right and make sure you’ve got everything you need. Then head straight to the lab room. Clock’s ticking, intern… move it
