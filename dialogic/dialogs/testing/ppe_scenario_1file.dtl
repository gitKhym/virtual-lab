Harvey\
Looking like a true scientist right there, intern. Always remember; proper attire and full PPE are the first steps to safety.
Harvey\
Before we begin, a few ground rules. No eating or drinking in the lab like ever. Follow the protocol for all spills, even the small ones. It’s about protecting you and everyone else.
Harvey\
Handle every piece of equipment with the utmost care. Treat it like it’s the only one we have because sometimes, it is.
Harvey\
All lab rubbish, including gloves, must go into the hazardous waste bins. Don’t leave them lying around.
Harvey\
In case of any emergency, follow the instructor’s lead immediately. No exceptions.
Harvey\
Anyway, we’ll be starting shortly. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the lab, and do be careful.

leave henry [animation="Slide Out Left"]
Narrator\
With surprising speed, his little legs scrambling away, leaving you in silence.
Narrator\
But then your eyes drift back across the room. Something feels… off. The place is messy. Full of litter, tipped-over equipment, and the faint smell of a spill
Player\
Hmm. This room is quite a mess. There must be something I can do…

label scenario1 (scenario1)
Narrator\
The intern notices a small chemical spill near their workstation.
label return1
Player\
Hmm, what’s this? Looks like a small chemical spill. It looks like paint. I better do something about it
- Wipe it quickly with tissues
	Narrator\
That seems dangerous.
	Narrator\
Tissues won’t neutralize chemicals and can spread  further contamination.
	jump return1
- Inform supervisor & follow spill protocol
	Player\
um hello Mr Harvey! I got something here!
	join HarveryTheRoo center [animation="Slide In Left"]
	Harvey\
Oh hey is everything good? *as he dashes towards you.
	Player \
There is a spill here, I think we should do something about it.
	Harvey\
Would you look at that! Thanks for notfying me. Hmm this little sign should do. 
	[signal arg="spill_correct"]
	[end_timeline]
- Do nothing
	Narrator\
That seems far off.  I feel like we should definitely not ignore it.

Later, the intern sees a classmate about to throw used gloves into the recycling bin.

Henry\
Hmm I wonder whats for lunch? These gloves are annoying. It makes my hands clammy! *He is about to throw his gloves in the recycle bin

	Player\
Wait!! Henry!
	Henry\
Woah what! You just gave me a heart attack! 
	Player\
I am so sorry! But your gloves dosen't go over there. It should be in that red bin right over there.
	Henry\
Wait! Haha, my bad. I almost didnt notice it. Thanks for that! *He finally threw his gloves in the right bin.
	[signal arg="waste_correct"]
	[end_timeline]
- Throw your gloves in the trash as well.
	Narrator\
Wait! I don think that is very wise my friend and spreads contamination even further.

Henry\
Finally, Smiff's limited chips is in my hands! I waited for so long to finally try them
label return3
Narrator\
You could see the gleam in his eyes as he is about to open the packet. But you know this is wrong.
- Pretend not to see
	Narrator\
Really are we really ignore it?
	jump return3
- Eat with them.
	Narrator\
Tempting I know, but food and labs don’t really mix. Remember cross-contamination is dangerous.
	jump return3
- Politely remind them that eating is not allowed
	Player \
Uh Henry, I dont we should eat in the lab.
	Henry\
Uh what! but I am really eager to try them right now.
	Player \
I know its tempting but there are rules we must uphold to have a safe environment. You could always wait.
	Henry\
I suppose you are right. *He placed his packet of chips in his bag. 
	Henry\
Come on Henry! you can wait a few hours.

label scenario4
Narrator\
Oh dear, look at Henry. He is carrying the microscope with one hand
join henry center [animation="Slide In Left"]
Henry\
Haha look at me. I can carry this thing with one hand! I knew lifting those bamboos paid off!
label return4
Narrator\
Sigh* At least he is happy but you know this is very improper in the lab. 
- Try carrying it with one hand too
	Narrator\
Wait?! is this some weightlifting competition? One wrong move and the microscope could fall or break.
	jump return4
- Ignore it
	Narrator\
Oh ho, you are doing this in purpose arent you?
	jump return4
- Tell them to use both hands, supporting the base
	Player\
Hey Henry. I am sure that you are very strong, but remember Microscopes are very delicate. You must hold them both at the base and at the bottom.
	Player\
Remember proper handling of equipment prevents damage to expensive equipment like the Microscope.
	Henry\
Expensive?! oh uh *He stabiliizes the microscope with both of his hands. Thanks for reminding me!
