Harvey\
Looking like a true scientist right there, intern. Always remember; proper attire and full PPE are the first steps to safety.
Harvey\
Before we begin, a few ground rules. No eating or drinking in the lab like ever. Follow the protocol for all spills, even the small ones. It’s about protecting you and everyone else.
Harvey\
Handle every piece of equipment with the utmost care. Treat it like it’s the only one we have because sometimes, it is.
Harvey\
All lab rubbish, including gloves, must go into the hazardous waste bins. Don’t leave them lying around.
Harvey\
In case of any emergency, follow the instructor’s lead immediately. No exceptions.
Harvey\
If you need a reminder, you can check the rules again on that board over there
Harvey\
Anyway, we’ll be starting shortly. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the lab, and do be careful.

Narrator\
With surprising speed, his little legs scramble away, leaving you in silence.
Narrator\
But then your eyes drift back across the room. Something feels… off. The place is messy. Full of litter, tipped-over equipment, and the faint smell of a spill
Player\
Hmm. This room is quite a mess. There must be something I can do…

Narrator\
The intern notices a small chemical spill near their workstation.

	Narrator\
spills must never be ignored. Tissues won’t neutralize chemicals and can spread contamination.

- Inform supervisor & follow spill protocol
	Narrator\
Well done. Reporting and following protocol ensures everyone’s safety.

Later, the intern sees a classmate about to throw used gloves into the recycling bin.
- Stop them and direct waste into biohazard bin
	Right! Contaminated gloves go in the biohazard waste bin.
