Now that the pipette is filled to the top...
We can now fill a container with our target goal.
In a real lab, you'd squeeze the bulb to hold the liquid in the pipette and release it gently to let the liquid flow out.
But, for this task click and hold the bulb to let the liquid slowly flow out until you've hit the goal.
Remember, the numbers on the pipette go "backward" because they show how much liquid has flowed out, not how much is left inside
